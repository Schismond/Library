# Library

This is a simple library application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add books to a library, display them, remove books, and toggle their read status.

## Getting Started

To get started with the library application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

### Adding a Book

To add a book to the library, follow these steps:

1. Fill in the book details in the form provided on the page. Enter the author's name, book title, number of pages, and select the read status.

2. Click the "Add Book" button. The book will be added to the library.

### Displaying Books

The library will display all the books you have added. Each book will be shown in a separate card with its details.

### Removing a Book

To remove a book from the library, click the "Remove" button on the respective book card. The book will be removed from the library.

### Changing Read Status

Each book card has a "Toggle Read Status" button. Clicking this button will change the read status of the book from "Read" to "Not Read" and vice versa.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to add additional features to the library application, such as:

- Persistent storage: Implementing storage functionality to save the library data, allowing users to revisit their library even after 
  closing the browser.
- Improved user interface: Enhancing the visual design and user experience of the application.
- Sorting and filtering: Adding options to sort and filter books based on different criteria.
- Multiple libraries: Allowing users to create and manage multiple libraries.

I appreciate your feedback and suggestions for improving the library application. Thank you for using My Library!
